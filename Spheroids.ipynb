    "The researchers didn’t realize it at the time, but their first design was inherently flawed. From a mathematical standpoint, unicellular organisms are very different beasts from whole creatures like cows: they are subject to statistical “noise.” Individual cells contain relatively few molecules, Khammash explained. Randomness from the probability that various molecules will meet, collide and react inside a cell comes into play much more forcefully.\n",

    "In the adult skeleton, bone is usually formed in\n",
    "a lamellar arrangement in which collagen fibers are\n",
    "laid in a parallel and orderly fashion. This arrangement\n",
    "is essential to the structure of the Haversian system of\n",
    "cortical bone, in which lamellar fibers are arranged\n",
    "concentrically around the central cavity (Haversian\n",
    "canal), from the center of which there is communication\n",
    "with osteocytes through the canaliculae. During bone\n",
    "development and other states of rapid bone formation,\n",
    "the collagen fiber alignment is more random; this is\n",
    "described as woven bone.\n",

    "Functional unit of bones: Osteon - diameter 250u m, with Haversian canal in the middle\n",
    "\n",
    "Osteoblast progenitors are associated with vascular\n",
    "structures in the marrow, and several studies suggest\n",
    "these progenitors may also give rise to cells forming\n",
    "the blood vessel and pluripotent perivascular cells\n",
    "[21e23] (Figs 2.1 and 2.3). Support for this comes\n",
    "from the use of the smooth muscle alpha-actin\n",
    "(SMAA) promoter to direct GFP to smooth muscle\n",
    "and pericytes, with strong osteogenic differentiation\n",
    "evident in cells positive for SMAA-GFP [24]. This indicates\n",
    "the capacity of SMAA to mark a population of\n",
    "osteoprogenitors, and reinforces the idea that one of\n",
    "the sources of osteoblast progenitors in bone remodeling\n",
    "is the pericyte [23].\n"
