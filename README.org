** Introduction

Biocompatibility is of new untested materials is an important field.
This robot is a proposal of an automated het-cam experiment.

** TODO Mechanics - Files and Bill of Materials   

*** TODO  Design files


*** TODO Bill of Materials

- PLA
- stepper motor driver
- stepper motor
- arduino
- raspberry 4
- raspberry hq video camera

**** Machines (and/or):
- FDM 3D-printer (Prusa MK3, but any model with an similar precision would do)

**** Tools:
- Soldering iron
- Hand tools (screwdrivers etc.)

How to make the script run on startup:
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

start cam with 
sudo CAMERA=opencv python3 run.py
to open on restricted port 80

How to make the script run on startup:
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
insert:
sudo CAMERA=opencv python3 run.py &

or for additional logging:
sudo CAMERA=opencv python3 run.py & > /home/pi/Desktop/log.txt 2>&1

to start an OpenCV session from bash, you can do this:

$ CAMERA=opencv python3 run.py

From a Windows command prompt you can do the same as follows:

on windows run:
$ python run.py CAMERA=opencv
$ py -3.7 run.py CAMERA=opencv

or:
$ set CAMERA=opencv
$ python run.py
$ py -3.7 run.py
